    <h1>Warli Art</h1>
    <p>
      Warli art is a traditional form of tribal art that originates from the Warli tribes of Maharashtra, India. This ancient art form is famous for its simplistic and geometric patterns, typically drawn using white pigment on mud or dark-colored walls. The artwork often reflects the daily life and rituals of the Warli people, as well as their connection with nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warli paintings are created using basic shapes like circles, triangles, and squares, which represent natural elements like the sun, moon, trees, animals, and human figures. These designs are often accompanied by scenes from daily life, such as farming, hunting, and community celebrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditionally, Warli art was painted on the walls of tribal huts during special occasions and festivals. Over time, it has evolved and found its place in modern art and decor, often showcased on canvas, paper, and other mediums.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simplicity and beauty of Warli art continue to captivate people around the world, making it one of India's most beloved folk art traditions.
