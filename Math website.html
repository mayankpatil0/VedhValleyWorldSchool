    Aryabhata, born in 476 CE in Kusumapura (modern-day Patna, India), was one of India’s greatest mathematicians 
    and astronomers, whose revolutionary contributions laid the foundation for modern mathematics and astronomy. 
    He introduced the concept of the place-value system, emphasized the use of zero, and approximated π (pi) as 
    3.1416, recognizing it as irrational. Aryabhata developed sine tables in trigonometry, solved quadratic 
    equations, and worked on indeterminate equations, known as "Kuttaka." In astronomy, he proposed that the Earth 
    rotates on its axis, calculated the length of a year as 365.358 days, and explained planetary orbits as elliptical. 
    His seminal work, <i>Aryabhatiya</i>, covered a wide range of topics, including arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, 
    and spherical astronomy, influencing later scholars like Brahmagupta and Arab mathematicians. Aryabhata’s theories 
    not only advanced Indian science but also left a profound impact on global scientific thought, cementing his legacy 
    as a pioneer in mathematics and astronomy.
